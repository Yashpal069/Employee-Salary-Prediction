# Employee-Salary-Prediction
I have worked on a project that involved predicting the salaries of employees.
To accomplish this, I used machine learning algorithms linear regression.
In the end, our models were able to predict employee salaries with an accuracy of over 90%.
this project was a great opportunity for me to apply my skills in data science and machine learning to a real-world problem.
